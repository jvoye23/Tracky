 * five parses for identical results.

     * walks every other directory in the repository -- including ones holding
     * Kotlin that is tooling or documentation rather than project code. Those are
     * sliced out here once rather than exempted rule by rule.
     *
     * Expressed as a list of owned roots, not as one hardcoded path, because the
     * engine no longer lives inside the harness's directory. When it moved, a
     * single `/.claude/` exclusion stopped covering it, and the failure mode of
     * that is silent in the dangerous direction: the scope *widens* to include
     * the framework's own Gradle init scripts and rule sources, and the rules
     * then report on code the consumer did not write and cannot fix.
     *
     * `.prism` is the framework's -- the engine, its assets, its state. `.claude`
     * is a harness's. The harness side gains entries in Phase 4, when the
     * remaining four adapters ship; each is a directory a harness owns inside the
     * consumer's repository, and none of them is project source.
     *
     * `prism-setup` is the extraction staging directory, and it is here because
     * of an ordering nobody would guess: setup runs `./gradlew staticAnalysis`
     * at step 8 to prove the wiring works, and does not delete the staging
     * directory until step 11. So the FIRST static-analysis run of every install
     * sees a second, complete copy of the payload sitting in the repository root
     * -- 152 declarations of it, on a project with two source files -- and
     * reports on all of it. The consumer's first impression of the framework
     * would be a wall of violations in files they had never opened.
