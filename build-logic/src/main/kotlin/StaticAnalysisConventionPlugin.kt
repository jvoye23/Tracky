/**
 * Gate 0, assembled on the root project.
 *
 * Two of the engine's scripts run `./gradlew staticAnalysis ktlintToolingClasspath`
 * by name — `stop-gate.sh` and `push-gate.sh` — and neither task is a Gradle
 * built-in. They were hand-written in the origin repository's root build file,
 * which meant the framework shipped gates calling tasks it did not supply: a
 * consumer who installed everything else got `Task 'staticAnalysis' not found`,
 * and gate 0 became a no-op the first time anything invoked it.
 *
 * Registering them here rather than in a template the consumer merges keeps the
 * wiring beside the plugins it matches on. The `plugins.withId` strings below are
 * the ids `build.gradle.kts` registers for `KtlintConventionPlugin` and
 * `DetektConventionPlugin`; getting one wrong silently drops every module of that
 * kind out of the aggregate, which is the framework's documented false-green
 * failure. In one file the ids and their consumers cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The consumer applies it to their root project and nothing else:
 *
 *     plugins { id("prism.static-analysis") }
