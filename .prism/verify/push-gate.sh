# PreToolUse(Bash) hook — the harness entry point to the push gate.
#
# This half answers one question: is the command in this event a `git push`, and
# which ref is it sending? Everything that follows from a yes lives in
# push-verify.sh, which takes a ref rather than an event and is reachable with
# nothing on stdin.
#
# The split is what makes .git/hooks/pre-push possible without a shim. Git
# already knows the command is a push and which refs it carries, so the floor
# calls the verification half directly and constructs no synthetic event to
# satisfy a parser written for a different caller. See push-verify.sh's header
# for why that path is the primary enforcement on two of the five supported
# harnesses rather than a fallback.
#
# Exit 0 = allow the push. Exit 2 = deny, reason on stderr.
