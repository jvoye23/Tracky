# Runs ktlint on the file that was just written, autocorrecting first and
# reporting only what is left. Formatting drift is fixed silently and never
# reaches the transcript; naming, imports and file layout — the violations
# that need a decision — are reported at file:line:col.

# Exit 0 = nothing to say. Exit 2 = report on stderr, which is the only exit
# code that puts the report in front of Claude; stderr from an exit-0 hook
# goes to the debug log alone.

# repo-wide staticAnalysis in a turn that did not cause it. The gate follows
# the file instead: `--git-common-dir` is identical for a repo and all of its
# worktrees (the same test prism_require_root uses), so a same-repo worktree
# is verified against ITS OWN root — its .editorconfig, its build files — and
# a file in an unrelated checkout stays out of scope as before.

# the hook then "corrected" files into a shape the Stop gate rejected.

# from there, paying the daemon cost on the first edit of a checkout rather
# than on every edit. An entry that no longer exists on disk is a Gradle
# cache eviction that would otherwise fail silently below — every entry is
# checked, not just the first, so the check survives the day the classpath
# grows a second jar.
