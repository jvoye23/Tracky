# prism-verify status — what would the coverage gate say right now?
#
# READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION, and that is the whole design:
#
#   * it renders a verdict and exits 0 no matter what it finds. It is not a
#     gate. It has no allow path, so there is nothing here to weaken and no
#     way to "pass" it.
#   * NO HOOK MAY CALL IT. A gate that consults a reporting script is a gate
#     whose verdict can be changed by editing the reporting script.
#   * it runs no Gradle task and touches no build output. It stats files and
#     reads XML.
#
# Why it exists: there was no way to see the gate's opinion without attempting
# a push. Section 6 needed the thirteen-module kind/freshness/coverage table
# constantly and hand-rolled a throwaway script for it every time — which is
# how a status view drifts away from what actually denies.
#
# It does not drift here because it asks the same questions of the same code:
# lib/coverage.py for kind, freshness, measurement and threshold, and
# lib/affected.sh's prism_refresh_commands for the commands to fix anything
# stale — the very renderer push-gate.sh prints from.
#
# Usage: sh .prism/verify/status.sh [module ...]

# WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY DENY, not what would deny if everything were promoted.
# The two structural arms below -- no jacoco wiring, and sources with no tests --
# used to print "would DENY" without asking scope.json anything, so on an
# all-observe install (which is what every install starts as) this table claimed
# two verdicts the coverage gate would never reach. That was tolerable while this
# script was a thing you had to know about; it stopped being tolerable when
# `./prism status` made it the primary screen.
#
# The measured arms need no such lookup: coverage.py's `verdict` already returns
# `observe` for a module the scope file observes.
