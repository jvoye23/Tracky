# SubagentStop hook — Principle VII gates at the SUBAGENT boundary.
#
#   gate 0 (module-scoped): detekt passes in every module the subagent
#                           touched that applies it
#   gate 1: every module the subagent touched compiles
#   gate 2: those modules' JVM unit tests pass
#
# Why this exists: .claude/settings.json wired Stop and PreToolUse(Bash) only,
# so a subagent was gated by nothing at all. Ten of them wrote several
# thousand lines here with zero gate coverage, and a :core:data that did not
# compile sat in the tree until the MAIN agent's Stop hook caught it — one
# whole turn later, after nine other subagents had built on top of it.
#
# Deliberately NARROWER than stop-gate.sh, and the differences are the point:
#
#   * scope is the modules with uncommitted work in the subagent's own tree,
#     never the whole project. Ten concurrent `./gradlew build` runs would
#     cost more than the hole this closes.
#   * it does NOT widen to dependents, and it does NOT widen to every module
#     when a global build file changes. Both of those are the Stop gate's
#     job, which still runs afterwards over the whole turn's work. This gate
#     is a fast fail at the boundary, not a second full verification.
#   * it skips subagents that cannot edit files at all. See
#     prism_agent_is_read_only below.
#
# Exit 0 = let the subagent stop. Exit 2 = block, reason on stderr.

# --- can this subagent fix a build failure at all? ------------------------
# Blocking a READ-ONLY subagent is nonsense. It has no Edit or Write tool, so
# the failing module is not something it can act on — and the tree it would
# be denied over is not one it wrote. Subagents share the main checkout
# unless they were dispatched into a worktree, so what this gate sees when a
# search or review agent stops is the MAIN agent's uncommitted work. Every
# such agent was paying for a Gradle build and then being refused its own
# stop over code it could not open a file in.
#
# The answer is read from the agent's OWN definition rather than from a list
# that goes stale: .claude/agents/<type>.md declares its tools, and an agent
# whose tools include neither Edit nor Write cannot change the tree. An agent
# with no definition file is VERIFIED — unknown means gate, not skip. The
# only names hardcoded are Claude Code's built-in read-only agents, which
# ship no definition file here to read.
#
# This narrows the gate, so it is worth being exact about what still covers
# the skipped case: everything. The Stop gate rebuilds the same modules, with
# dependents included, before the turn can end. Nothing reaches a commit or a
# push on the strength of this skip.
