# The verification half of the push gate: Principle VII gates 0, 2 and 3, run
# against a repository state. Exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = deny with the reason on
# stderr.
#
#   gate 0: static analysis passes across the repository
#   gate 2: everything the change reaches compiles and its unit tests pass
#   gate 3: instrumentation + unit tests pass, and coverage clears thresholds
#
# Usage: sh push-verify.sh [<source-ref>]
#
# It takes a ref, not an event. That is the whole point of the split.
#
# All of this used to sit below push-gate.sh's event parser, reachable only by
# feeding a harness's JSON in on stdin — so the framework's central promise, that
# unverified work does not reach a remote, was available exactly where a harness
# chose to offer a PreToolUse hook and nowhere else. Per the capability matrix
# that is not a portability nicety: Copilot CLI documents hook timeouts as
# "always fail-open, even for preToolUse", at a 30 second default, and
# Antigravity defaults to 30 with no documented maximum. This gate runs static
# analysis, a build and a coverage pass. For those two harnesses a hook is not a
# weaker enforcement path, it is one that can be timed out of existence — and
# .git/hooks/pre-push is the primary enforcement rather than a fallback.
#
# The seam was already marked in the source it was cut from. Everything above it
# answers "is this command a push, and which ref is it sending"; git knows both
# without being asked, so a git hook needs none of it and constructs no synthetic
# event to pretend otherwise.

# agent blocked by a rule could set `active: false` in detekt.yml and nothing
# anywhere noticed. It is tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof -- this script is
# itself a file the agent can write. What it buys is that weakening now costs a
# separate commit somebody sees.
#

# is never innocent -- it is a partial install, or the one file an agent would

# is the failure this gate exists to prevent, and on an allow path nobody would

#   "A timed-out command, http, or mcp_tool hook doesn't block the tool call.
#    The call continues through the normal permission flow, so don't count on
#    a stalled hook to act as a gate."   — code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks

# instant and reliable; performing must be long, visible and resumable. So

# milliseconds, and it still computes the number itself rather than trusting
# anyone's claim. When those artifacts are missing or stale it denies with
