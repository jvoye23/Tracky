# `observe` exists so that a repository which did not grow up under 72 rules is
# not red on day one. Getting that wrong has a specific shape, and it is not
# "the gate lets something through": it is A DOCTOR THAT FAILS ON A SUPPORTED
# CONFIGURATION. That was the recorded reason for rejecting this design once
# already -- a doctor people learn to ignore stops catching the installs that
# are genuinely broken, and the framework loses its only mechanical judge.
#
# So the cases below are mostly about the report rather than the exit code, and
# they pin both directions: an observe install with no floor must PASS and say
# it was chosen, while an enforcing one with no floor must still FAIL.
