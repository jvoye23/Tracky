# Tests for the base branch — the one configuration knob that travels the whole
# route in this phase. Sourced by run-tests.sh.
#
# It is declared in templates/parameters.json, rendered into .prism/prism.json
# by lib/render.py, and read back by lib/config.sh through
# prism_require_base_branch. This file is the evidence that the route works end
# to end rather than in three separately-tested halves: one knob makes the trip
# now so that a defect in the mechanism surfaces with a single caller written
# against it rather than nine (design D6).
#
# What it replaced was `PRISM_BASE_BRANCH="${PRISM_BASE_BRANCH:-master}"`, and
# the failure that default produced is the one worth keeping in view. A consumer
# whose trunk is `main` got a gate that either resolved no merge base at all or,
# with a stale local `master` lying around, resolved one against the wrong ref
# and verified a scope that was not the change. Nothing said so, because a
# default that is present looks exactly like a value that was chosen.

# --- the round trip ------------------------------------------------------
#
# A fixture whose history makes the base branch OBSERVABLE. Two branches sit at
# different commits, so the scope computed against one is a different set of
# files from the scope computed against the other:
#
#   S ── M (master, edits :core:other) ── F (feature, edits :core:domain)
#   └─ release
#
# From F, the merge base with `master` is M, so only :core:domain changed. The
# merge base with `release` is S, so :core:other changed too. Nothing but the
# value in prism.json distinguishes the two runs.

# it is a reporting tool that performs nothing, and reading the record is its
# entire job.

# satisfy a grep rather than the property. The property is that no gate
# consults the value: through prism_config_get, through a JSON read, or through
# an environment variable. Prose may say the word; code may not fetch it.
