# Tests for the two remaining rule-group switches in detekt.yml.in, and for the
# twenty-seven rules that no longer have one. Sourced by run-tests.sh.
#
# THERE USED TO BE SIX SWITCHES OVER THIRTY-TWO RULES. Four are deleted, and
# the reason is a measurement: ten installs of one unchanged repository
# produced four different rule sets, all passing prism-doctor, because the
# switches were decided by an agent reading prose and the same harness reached
# opposite answers on identical code forty minutes apart. MVI, MODULE_PATH,
# NAV and TEST_STACK are now unconditionally active. What is CHECKED is the
# same in every repository; what BLOCKS is moved through .prism/scope.json.
#
# TWO SURVIVE, and only because they guard a NAME the repository may not have.
# A repository can hold a theme composable, an extended-token holder and a
# theme package and still keep its raw colours as top-level vals -- no
# declaration to name. That is a fact about the repository, not a judgment
# about it, so it is probed rather than argued, and the switch records what the
# probe found. With one switch over all five rules that shape had no honest
# answer, and an install wrote paletteObject: 'none' with the rules left ON:
# both matched nothing and reported success over five files that violated them.
#
# WHAT THESE TESTS ARE GUARDING. Three failures now:
#
#   * a rule that quietly REGAINS a switch -- the 27 are asserted against the
#     TEMPLATE, not the rendered output, so `active: @ANYTHING@` on one of them
#     fails here even if today's values happen to render it true.
#   * a surviving switch that flips MORE than its group -- a rule silently
#     deactivated in a repository that has the shape it checks.
#   * a surviving switch that flips LESS than its group -- one member left
#     hardcoded `active: true`, so the switch appears not to work.
#
# All three are invisible in review of a 450-line YAML file and one grep away
# here, so the membership lists below are duplicated from the template ON
# PURPOSE. A test that derived them from the file it is testing would agree
# with any mistake the file makes.
