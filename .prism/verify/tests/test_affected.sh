# They used to run against the ambient repository, which worked only while
# this repository was itself the Android project under test. Extracting the
# framework into a product repository ended that: prism_module_for_path
# returned empty for every path and ten assertions failed for a reason that
# had nothing to do with module mapping.

# per-module gate iterated over them like any other. `:tooling:konsist` has a
# src/test and NO src/main, so the coverage gate measured a report with zero
# lines, called it `no-line-data`, and DENIED THE PUSH on a module the installer
# had just placed. A framework must not fail a repository on its own code.
