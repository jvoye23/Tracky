# Tests for ./prism — the three verbs, and the two collisions they resolved.
# Sourced by run-tests.sh.
#
# THE INTERFACE IS THE FEATURE HERE. The first person to install PRISM from
# outside this repository reported the CLI as "way too complicated ... it would
# be intuitive to just have a setup command and that's it", and the count backed
# him up: 41 invocable things, 17 of them pure reporting. So the assertions below
# are unusually interested in what the help text says, because a shipped command
# nobody can find is the same defect as one that does not work.
#
# Two collisions are pinned:
#
#   1. `enforce` MEANT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. `./prism enforce :mod` rewrote one
#      module's scope entry; `prism-verify enforce` installed the floor, removed
#      scope.json and wrote the record. prism-doctor recommended the second by
#      name, from inside a repository where the first was what you had. The
#      action has one name now, and one implementation.
#   2. THERE WERE TWO `status` COMMANDS, each holding half the truth, and
#      ./prism's own help apologised for it in writing: "./prism status shows
#      posture and baselines, not coverage."
#
# And M3: the suppressed count printed detekt's XML tag names as though they were
# English, so the screen said `suppressed=0` beside 330 entries that were all
# suppressed. That inverts the one number a promotion decision turns on, which is
# why tp_status asserts on the reading and not merely on the number.
