"""Tests for the one command that carries a human from artifact to install.

Everything here was verified by hand first, on a real terminal, against the real
artifact. This file exists because that is not a thing anyone will do again, and
the two defects it pins are exactly the kind that survive by never being checked:

  1. WITH SEVERAL AGENT CLIS INSTALLED, bootstrap refused to guess and EXITED 0
     having written nothing -- so `prism-verify setup` reported success over an
     empty install, on every machine that has more than one agent on it.
  2. THE LAST LINE OF THE INSTALL WAS HARDCODED `/prism-setup` FOR ALL FIVE
     HARNESSES, which is wrong for Codex ($name) and wrong for Copilot (no
     per-skill command exists at all). The hand-off dead-ended on its final
     instruction, on the harnesses nobody had walked by hand.

A real pty is used where a real pty is what is under test: whether it ASKS, and
whether `exec` hands the terminal to the agent. Neither can be observed through a
pipe, because both are gated on `[ -t 0 ]` -- which is itself the behaviour that
keeps this from hanging a CI job.

PATH is replaced with stubs in every test. Reading the machine's real CLIs would
make the result depend on what the person running the suite happens to have
installed, and the ambiguous case would not exist on a machine with one agent.
