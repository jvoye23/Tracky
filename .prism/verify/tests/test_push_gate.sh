# Tests for push-gate.sh wiring. Sourced by run-tests.sh.
#
# Scope note: this file asserts WIRING — that a detected push resolves a
# range, derives modules, and reaches gate 3's pre-check with the right
# verdict. It does NOT assert command detection form by form. Those
# assertions used to live here and drove the whole hook with
# PRISM_SKIP_GATE3=1, which is the only reason that switch existed in the
# shipped code path. They now live in tests/test_push_detect.py's
# MigratedFromTheGateSuiteTests, which asks the detector the same questions
# directly. The two false-positive cases below stay here because they assert
# the HOOK exits 0 on a non-push, which is a wiring claim, not a detection one.
#
# The only environment variables used here are PRISM_DRY_RUN,
# PRISM_PUSH_FORCE_MODULES, and PRISM_PUSH_RANGE_OVERRIDE. None of them
# skips a gate's verdict: the first two stop before any gate runs, and the
# third only substitutes a range so the diff-failure path can be reached.
GATE="$HOOK_DIR/push-gate.sh"
# The verification half. push-gate.sh is now the event parser and hands over to
