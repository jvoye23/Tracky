# Tests for handoff.py — the end of the install, and the only place PRISM
# deletes anything in a consumer's repository.
# Sourced by run-tests.sh.
#
# TWO PROPERTIES ARE PINNED HERE, and neither is about the happy path.
#
#   1. A FAILING DOCTOR REMOVES NOTHING. "Remove the installer once everything is
#      ready" has a load-bearing second half: a repository that did not verify
#      still needs its installer in order to try again.
#   2. IDENTITY, NOT NAME. Until 0.6.2 the payload was removed by an `rm -rf`
#      that an agent typed out of a document, and the artifact was never removed
#      at all. Deleting a path because of what it is called is how a piped
#      variant of one such line destroyed three konsist templates during 0.6.0's
#      phase 7. So a file called `prism-verify` that is not an installer archive
#      must SURVIVE, and say why.
