# Tests for prism-doctor's harness check — D8. Sourced by run-tests.sh.
#
# The harness-adapter spec puts one sentence on the production decision path:
# REGISTRATION IS NOT ENFORCEMENT. Four ways a harness ends up configured
# correctly and gating nothing were observed while probing, and in every one the
# failure mode is silence rather than an error.
#
# So the check that reads those registrations has to be shown a broken tree, not
# only a good one. Every case below sabotages exactly one thing and requires the
# doctor to fail and to name it. A verifier that has only ever been run against
# a correct install is an assertion, not a check.

#
# All three are supported. None was a reason to refuse writing a file. This is
# the same rule D6 already follows for a declined pre-push floor: a chosen,
# documented state reports as chosen, because a doctor that fails a supported
# configuration is a doctor people learn to ignore.
#
# Missed for a whole test round because every prior probe ran BARE preflight;
# the harness block only executes when --harness is passed.
#
# RUN IN A FIXTURE, NOT IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY. This loop used to invoke
# prism-doctor wherever the suite happened to be running. In a checkout that is
# a git repository and preflight proceeds; inside the EXTRACTED ARCHIVE it is
# not, preflight answers "not a git repository, and PRISM_ROOT is unset", and
# every harness comes back UNDETERMINED. The assertion then failed for a reason
# that had nothing to do with what it was testing -- and it failed only in the
# one place that matters, since build-zip.sh runs this suite from inside the
# archive it is about to ship. Every other check in this file already uses a
