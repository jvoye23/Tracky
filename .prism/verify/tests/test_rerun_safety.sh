# A second install run must not undo the first install's work.
#
# test_place.py proves the three outcomes of the placement mechanism one call at
# a time. This suite proves the SEQUENCE, because the loss was never a single
# call: it was step 5a and step 8b, then weeks of promotion, then step 5a and
# step 8b again. Every individual copy was correct. The composite destroyed the
# only file that decides what blocks.
#
# WHAT WAS LOST, concretely. `.prism/scope.json` is the record of which modules
# have been promoted, so a re-run that restored the all-`observe` template
# demoted every module at once -- silently, because no gate reports a posture and
# nothing in the install's own output mentioned the file. `./prism status` was
# the only place it ever showed, and only if somebody happened to run it.
#
# So the assertions below walk the real install commands from SETUP.md, in the
# real order, with a real promotion in the middle.
