"""A push may not both need a weakening and contain it.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. PRISM's gates are configured by files in the repository the
agent is editing. Before this, an agent blocked by a rule could set
`active: false` in detekt.yml and NOTHING NOTICED -- no gate compared any
configuration against anything. That hole predates per-module posture and is
wider than it: R7 forbids a config switch that softens a gate, and then R7's
own permissive half grants rule-disabling as ordinary detekt mechanics.

So this compares the configuration in the working tree against the same
configuration on the BASE BRANCH, and denies when it got weaker. Promotion is
never checked; only weakening is.

WHAT IT IS NOT. Tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-PROOF, and the documentation must
say so. Every PRISM gate lives in a file the agent can write, including this
one. What the guard buys is that weakening now costs a separate commit that a
human sees, with a one-line diff whose entire purpose is visible -- instead of
one line buried in a 450-line YAML file inside an unrelated change. Nothing
local can do better than that; only CI evaluating config it checks out itself
can, and that is deliberately out of PRISM's scope.

DEMOTION IS STILL ALLOWED. It just cannot ride along with the work that needed
it. Make it its own commit, merge it to the base branch, and every later push
agrees.

    Windows, where that is exactly what os.path.relpath produces -- and
    baseline_paths() below builds every baseline path that way.

    This mattered because of which side failed. in_tree() reads the same path
    through os.path.join, which accepts either separator, so the working tree was
    read correctly while the base branch came back as CalledProcessError. The
    except clause turns that into None, and None is how this module spells "the

    check concluded there had been no baseline to weaken, and the anti-weakening
    guard stood down. No crash, no message, and a push that deleted suppressions
    from a committed baseline was accepted.
