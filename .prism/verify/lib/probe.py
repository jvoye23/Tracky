"""Find the three consumer names the design-system rules need, mechanically.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Ten installs of one unchanged repository once produced four
different rule sets, all passing prism-doctor, because six group switches were
decided by an agent reading prose -- and the same harness reached opposite
answers on identical code forty minutes apart. Four of those switches are now
deleted. The two that survive guard a NAME, and a name is not a judgment: a
repository either has a declaration holding its raw colours or it does not.
This probe answers that question the same way every time.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It never guesses between candidates. PRISM's failure mode
is the silent green -- a rule pointed at a name that matches nothing reports
success over the code it was aimed at -- so an ambiguous answer exits 3 and
names every candidate it found. A human picks; the probe records the choice
and the evidence. Being undecided out loud is the supported outcome; being
confidently wrong is the one this file exists to prevent.

Output is JSON on stdout (--json) or a report on stderr-shaped prose. The
values are the ones setup feeds to render.py verbatim, and both the values and
the evidence belong in .prism/INSTALL-RECORD.md.
