"""Detects a real `git push` invocation inside a Bash tool_input command.

Replaces a line-anchored `grep -E` that had two false-positive holes (see
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-verification-gate-hooks-design.md fix log,
2026-08-16 "FIX 7"):

  1. `grep -E` matches per LINE, so a `^`-anchored pattern matches the start
     of every line of a multi-line command, not just the start of the
     command — so a heredoc body writing documentation could be read as a
     fresh command.
  2. `(` was in the "this starts a new command" delimiter class, so a bare
     parenthesis inside ordinary prose (e.g. a commit message mentioning a
     push) read as a command separator.

This module fixes both by (a) stripping heredoc bodies — they are DATA, not
shell syntax — before looking at anything, and (b) tokenizing what remains
with `shlex` in POSIX mode, so a quoted argument (a commit message, a `-m`
value, an echo argument) becomes ONE token and can never be mistaken for
separate `git` and `push` words.

It also has to recognise "command position" after more than just a
punctuation boundary (`;`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`): a command can equally start
right after a shell keyword or a wrapper word — `if git push; then`, `{ git
push; }`, `time git push`, `nohup git push &`, `sudo git push`,
`env git push`, `timeout 5 git push`, `stdbuf -oL git push`.
`_LEADING_KEYWORDS` lists the words this module treats as "the next token
is a fresh command", so `git` immediately after one of them is still
checked.

Two more holes were found and closed by a follow-up review (2026-08-16,
review round after "FIX 7"), both in the direction that matters most for a
gate — a false NEGATIVE, a real push slipping through ungated:

  - `shlex` defaults to treating `#` as a comment starter outside quotes.
    Since a bare newline is swapped for `;` before tokenizing (see
    `_tokenize`), a `#` anywhere — even on an unrelated earlier line, e.g. a
    leading `# deploy the branch` comment — would swallow every token after
    it, including a real `git push` later on. `_tokenize` now sets
    `lexer.commenters = ""` so `#` is just an ordinary character; it is
    still inert inside quotes, same as any other character.
  - An unbalanced quote (e.g. an apostrophe in ordinary prose, `echo it's a
    plan; git push`) makes `_tokenize` unable to tokenize at all. The
    previous version treated that the same as "no push found" — safe for a
    false positive, but wrong for a gate, where a false negative (unverified
    code reaching the remote) is the failure that must not happen. On a
    tokenize failure, `is_push_command` now falls back to `_coarse_scan_gates`,
    a deliberately blunt case-insensitive "does `git` appear before `push`
    on some line" scan that GATES on a hit. Over-gating a malformed command
    is correct; silently allowing one is not.

Deliberately NOT a full shell parser. Known imperfect cases, left as-is
because they are rarer than the holes above and — for these remaining ones
specifically — the fallback direction (fail toward "not a push") is the
safer one to be wrong in for a false positive, not a false negative, because
tokenizing itself still succeeds for them (so the coarse-scan fallback above
does not apply):

  - A herestring (`<<<'...'`) whose quoted body is not a heredoc and is not
    stripped by strip_heredocs; relies on shlex's normal quote handling
    instead, which is usually but not provably correct for it.
  - `git push` written only inside a `$(...)`/backtick command substitution
    is not specially unwrapped, but is still gated as an ordinary word
    sequence (arguably correctly, since it would still execute).

Shell indirection — `sh -c '...'`, `bash -lc '...'`, `eval "..."` — WAS out
of scope and was a one-token bypass of the whole gate. `_unwrapped_shell_
payloads` now hands the payload string back to `is_push_command` (bounded
recursion), which is the right tool for it. Likewise, any unrecognised
dash-led token after `git` is now skipped as a global option rather than
read as the subcommand: `git --git-dir=.git push` and
`git --literal-pathspecs push` used to sail through ungated.
