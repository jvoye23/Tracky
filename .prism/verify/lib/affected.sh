# convention plugins — and PRISM no longer ships any. Those plugins configured
# compileSdk, minSdk and jvmTarget: they were the origin project's build setup,
# not verification, and a framework that rewrites the build it is checking is
# the wrong shape. Asking about AGP asks the question that was always meant.
