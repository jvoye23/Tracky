"""Which engines block, in which modules.

THE FILE IS OPTIONAL AND ITS ABSENCE IS NOT NEUTRAL. No `.prism/scope.json`
means every engine enforces in every module. That is the state a repository
REACHES: work the baselines to zero, delete the file, and every engine blocks
everywhere. So a missing file is the STRICT reading, never the permissive one,
and a scope file that fails to load must not quietly become "nothing blocks".

  {
    "default": { "detekt": "observe", "ktlint": "observe",
                 "konsist": "observe", "coverage": "observe" },
    "modules": { ":core:domain": { "detekt": "enforce" } }
  }

A module entry is a PARTIAL override -- engines it does not name fall back to
`default`. That keeps promotion to one line, which matters, because a promotion
somebody has to hand-write four times is a promotion they batch up and stop
doing.

WHAT `observe` MEANS, EXACTLY. The engine runs, produces its reports, and does
not fail the build. It does not mean the rules are off, it does not mean the
findings are hidden, and it is not a place to leave things forever: the point
of recording it per module is that `prism status` can say how long it has been
there.

Fails closed, on the same terms as lib/config.sh: an unreadable or invalid
scope file makes the caller DENY and say why, rather than fall back to a
built-in. A file nobody can parse is the one case where guessing is worst.
