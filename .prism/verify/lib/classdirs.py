"""Stale compiled-class directories left behind by an AGP major upgrade.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Coverage is measured by handing JaCoCo the directory a module
compiled its classes into. AGP moved that directory in 9.x: it writes
build/intermediates/built_in_kotlinc/<variant>/<task>/classes, where 8.x wrote
build/tmp/kotlin-classes/<variant>. Upgrading does not remove the old tree --
nothing does, short of `./gradlew clean` -- so a repository that has been
through the upgrade carries two directories holding the same class NAMES
compiled by two different compilers.

Measured on a 26-module repository upgraded from AGP 8.x to 9.1.0: every
build/tmp/kotlin-classes was ten months old, and no AGP 9 build had written
there. Handed both, JaCoCo refuses -- "Can't add different class with same
name" -- and coverage could not be measured, and so could not be enforced, on
20 of the 26 modules.

The init scripts no longer read these paths: they ask the compile task where it
actually wrote. This module exists for the residue itself, which is worth
removing once at install and worth naming if it turns up later.

`sweep` only ever removes a directory that has a NEWER sibling holding the same
kind of output. A lone directory is this build's real output whatever it is
called, and is never touched.
