"""Put a payload file where it belongs WITHOUT overwriting the consumer's work.

SETUP.md has always promised this and nothing implemented it:

    Setup is idempotent. Running it again reports what differs and writes only
    what the consumer has not edited; anything they changed is left alone with
    the new version beside it as `<file>.prism-new`.

Until 0.6.0 that paragraph described no code. Every placement in step 5 was a
plain `cp`, so a second run overwrote whatever the consumer had edited since the
first, silently, and the `.prism-new` file the sentence named did not exist
anywhere in the repository. The concrete loss was `.prism/scope.json`: re-running
setup restored the all-`observe` template over a repository that had spent weeks
promoting modules, and `./prism status` was the only place it showed.

THE THREE OUTCOMES, and they are reported rather than guessed at:

  PLACED     nothing was there. The file is now ours.
  UNCHANGED  byte-identical to what we ship. Nothing to do, nothing to say.
  KEPT       it differs, so THEIRS STAYS. Ours lands beside it as
             <dest>.prism-new and the summary says so.

KEPT IS NOT AN ERROR AND MUST NOT BE TREATED AS ONE. A consumer editing a rule
set, a threshold or a scope file is the framework working as intended -- step 5
hands them `tooling/` precisely so they can. The failure mode this guards is the
opposite one: an installer that treats its own copy as the truth and quietly
reverts a decision somebody made on purpose.

The exit status is about whether the *operation* worked, never about whether
files differed: 0 for a completed run, 1 for a real failure (unreadable source,
undeletable temp file). A caller that wants to know what differed reads the
summary, which names every KEPT path. Making a difference fatal would push the
agent toward the one recovery that loses the work -- delete theirs and re-run.

Deliberately NOT a merge. Two files that differ are not reconciled here, because
nothing in this process can know which half of a conflict matters; `lines` is the
one exception, and only because appending an absent line to a `.gitignore` is
mechanical rather than a judgement.

    Found on Windows via test_place, where the fixture wrote CRLF because
