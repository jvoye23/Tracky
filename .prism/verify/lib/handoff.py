"""Finish the install: verify it, remove the installer, say what the human has.

Three things happen here that used to happen nowhere, or happen as prose.

VERIFY FIRST, AND REMOVE NOTHING IF IT FAILS. "Remove the installer once
everything is ready" has a load-bearing second half. A repository whose doctor
does not pass still needs the installer, so a failing verdict removes nothing at
all and says so. This is the one ordering rule in the file.

REMOVE BY PROVEN IDENTITY, NEVER BY NAME. Until 0.6.2 nothing removed the
artifact: `prism-verify` stayed in the repository root forever as a stale,
versioned copy of the whole framework, and `prism-setup/` was removed by a bare
`rm -rf` that an agent typed from a document. Deleting a path because of what it
is called is how a recipe like that destroys something it did not mean to -- a
piped variant of one such line destroyed three konsist templates during 0.6.0's
phase 7. So every candidate here must PROVE it is the installer before it is
touched: the payload directory by carrying SETUP.md and a VERSION equal to the
installed one, the artifacts by being archives that contain SETUP.md. Anything
that fails its test is left alone and named in the report. `.prism/` and
`./prism` are never candidates.

SAY WHAT THE REPOSITORY NOW HAS, MECHANICALLY. The install used to end with
`Launching …` and then whatever the agent chose to write afterwards, so the one
sentence every human needs -- ./prism is the command now, .prism/ is where it
lives -- was improvised prose that a distracted session could simply omit. It is
a printed banner now.

The banner LISTS the commands and says what each does. It does not tell the
reader which one to run.
