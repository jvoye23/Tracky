# Read PRISM's runtime configuration. Sourced, never executed.
#
# Runtime configuration is the first of the three substitution classes: it is
# read live on every run and rendered into nothing. Changing a value takes
# effect on the next gate invocation with no file regenerated.
#
# Because gates read these values, this file sits on the production decision
# path, and it inherits that path's rule: an inability to ask the question is
# not an answer of "no". A configuration file that is absent, unparseable, or
# missing a key a gate needs makes that gate DENY and say why. It does not fall
# back to a built-in default.
#
# The framework already learned this on the line above push-gate.sh's extractor:
# a broken python3 once allowed EVERY push through, ungated and silently,
# because "could not read" and "nothing to check" printed the same thing. The
# same trap is available here -- a missing prism.json quietly meaning "use the
# defaults" would gate a consumer's repository against PRISM's guesses while
# reporting success. So this distinguishes the two cases with a sentinel, as
# push-gate.sh does.

# Where the config lives. PRISM_CONFIG is an override for the test suite and
# for a caller running against a tree that is not its own; it cannot disable
# anything, only redirect the read.
