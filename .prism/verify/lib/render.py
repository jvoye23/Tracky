"""Render a PRISM template by substituting @NAME@ placeholders.

The framework ships files that cannot be finished until they are in a
consumer's repository: the package root konsist analyses, the module-to-package
map, the coverage thresholds a team chose. This renders those.

Three properties, and each exists because its absence is a silent failure
rather than a loud one:

  1. @NAME@, not ${NAME}. Templates are written in Kotlin, Gradle Kotlin DSL,
     POSIX shell, JSON and Markdown, and ${...} is live syntax in the first
     three. A renderer using it cannot tell a placeholder from the file's own
     content, and would corrupt exactly the files that most need templating.

  2. An unresolved placeholder is an ERROR, and nothing is written. A
     partially-substituted file is syntactically plausible, installs without
     complaint, and encodes a literal "@PACKAGE_ROOT@" where a package root
     belongs. It fails by succeeding -- the same class of failure detekt's
     `config.validation: true` and DetektConventionPlugin's explicit
     source.setFrom(...) exist to prevent.

  3. Three parameter tiers, because deferring a value is not free. A value the
     framework OWNS is baked in and is not a parameter at all. A value the
     CONSUMER owns but for which an honest default exists is defaulted, so it
     renders unattended. Only a value the consumer owns AND for which no honest
     default exists is required. Every parameter pushed up that list is one
     fewer thing the setup agent can get wrong.

The tier that must never be fudged is the third. Shipping the origin
repository's own value as a "sensible default" for a required parameter
produces an install that renders cleanly, reports success, and analyses a tree
the consumer does not have.

Python 3 standard library only. This adds no prerequisite: the engine already
denies a push outright when python3 cannot be run (push-gate.sh), on the
argument that a missing interpreter must never be read as "nothing to check".
