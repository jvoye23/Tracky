"""Read and edit the detekt baseline. Standard library only.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. `detektBaseline` REPLACES the baseline it is
pointed at -- it keeps only <ManuallySuppressedIssues> from the file it finds
and writes this run's findings as the whole <CurrentIssues> set. So several
tasks pointed at one file leave the LAST one's findings and nothing else: a
baseline that looks complete, suppresses one task's sources, and silently
un-suppresses the rest the next time anything runs. The convention plugin
therefore sends each creation task to its own fragment under
build/prism/baseline/, and `collect` unions them here.

ONE BASELINE PER MODULE, AND THAT IS 0.6.0's CORRECTION. Until then there was a
single file at the repository root, justified in DetektConventionPlugin by a
claim that turned out to be false: that "baseline ids embed the file path
relative to basePath, so entries from fifteen modules cannot collide". They do
not embed the path. A real id is

    AbstractClassCanBeInterface:AgendaBindsModule.kt:AgendaBindsModule$...

-- a BARE FILENAME -- and `basePath` does not change it. Measured on one
26-module repository's own baseline: 193 ids, 0 containing a path separator, 84
distinct file components, 36 of them appearing more than once. `RunningTracker.kt`
existed in both `:run:domain` and `:wear:run:domain`, so their entries were
indistinguishable, and `write()` deduplicates -- TWO findings were recorded as
ONE entry.

The consequence was a FALSE GREEN, which is worse than a false denial. Promoting
`:run:domain` could not tell which entries were that module's, correctly refused
to guess, and kept them -- and the kept entries were suppressing six real
findings in the module being promoted. `staticAnalysis` would have reported green
over code that was not clean.

A per-module file cannot do that: an entry in `:run:domain/detekt.baseline.xml`
is only ever read while analysing `:run:domain`. It also makes attribution exact
rather than inferred -- `drop --module` is now a file, not a guess at which
module a bare filename belonged to -- and it matches ktlint, which has always
kept one baseline per module. The residual limit is honest and much smaller: two
same-named files INSIDE one module still share an entry, and nothing here can
see that, because two tasks reporting the same finding look identical to it.

WHAT THE BASELINE IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT FOR. It records findings that
existed the day PRISM was installed so that day one is not a red build. Every
rule stays live: a NEW violation of a baselined rule still fails. It is not a
way to switch a rule off -- that is `active: false` in detekt.yml, and the two
must not be confused, because a rule that does not apply here should never come
back and a finding that was baselined should.

THE ONE DIRECTION THIS TOOL MOVES. `drop` removes suppression; `collect`
refuses to write over an existing baseline. Regenerating over a baseline
absorbs every violation written since the install -- quietly, and in exactly
the repositories where nobody would notice. A seam may over-block, never allow,
so the workday operation subtracts and the additive one asks first.
