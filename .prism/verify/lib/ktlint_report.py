"""ktlint plain-reporter parsing for the per-edit hook.

Two jobs, both kept out of ktlint.sh so they can be tested without a JVM:

  * read the edited file path out of a PostToolUse event, and decide whether
    it is a Kotlin path this gate covers at all;
  * turn ktlint's plain output into the report the agent sees, keeping only
    violations in the file that was actually edited.

The second filter is defensive rather than load-bearing — the hook passes
ktlint one path — but a report that names a file the agent did not touch is
worse than no report, so it is asserted here rather than assumed.
