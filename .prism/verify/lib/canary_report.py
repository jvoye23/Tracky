"""Decide, from a detekt report, whether the PRISM rule set actually ran.

This is the one question in the whole framework that cannot be answered by
reading configuration, because the failure it exists to catch looks exactly
like success: a rules module that was copied in but never put on the
`detektPlugins` configuration produces a detekt run that loads zero rules and
reports BUILD SUCCESSFUL over unexamined code.

`prism-doctor` plants a file that violates a *PRISM-owned* rule and runs detekt
over it. This module reads what came back. A built-in detekt rule would fire
even with the rule set entirely absent, which is why the canary rule must be
one of ours.

FOUR VERDICTS, and the distinction between the last three is the entire value:

    found                the rule fired. The rule set is live.
    file-analysed        detekt read the canary and did not report the rule.
                         THE FALSE GREEN. detekt is running; our rules are not
                         loaded.
    not-analysed         a report exists but never mentions the canary file, so
                         detekt did not read it. A source-set problem, not a
                         rule-loading problem, and saying so saves the reader
                         from checking the wrong four things.
    no-report /          nothing to read. UNDETERMINED, never a pass: an
    unreadable           inability to ask the question is not an answer of no.

Report format. detekt 2.0 emits `checkstyle` XML — the type was renamed from
`xml`, and `DetektReports` has no `xml` member at all. Each finding is an
`<error>` whose `source` attribute is the literal `detekt.` followed by the
bare rule id, NOT the ruleset-qualified one:

    <checkstyle version="4.3">
      <file name="/abs/path/to/PrismDoctorCanary.kt">
        <error line="4" column="5" severity="error"
               message="Remove the 'println' call from shipped code."
               source="detekt.NoConsoleLogging" />
      </file>
    </checkstyle>

The `name` attribute is resolved against detekt's `basePath`, which the
convention plugin sets to the root project. It may therefore be absolute or
relative depending on configuration, so files are matched on SUFFIX. Matching
an absolute path would fail on exactly the correctly-configured repositories.
