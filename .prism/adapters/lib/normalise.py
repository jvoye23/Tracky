"""Translate one harness's hook payload into the shape the gates already read.

The gates are agent-agnostic; the harnesses are not. Every supported harness
delivers a different JSON document for the same event -- different key names,
different nesting, different casing, and in two cases a field that simply is not
there. Rather than teach four gates about five harnesses, this translates at the
edge and leaves the engine reading exactly what it has always read.

THE CANONICAL SHAPE is Claude Code's, because that is what the gates were
written against and what `docs/harness-capability-matrix.md` records as the
gate-side requirement:

    tool_input.command    push-gate.sh:29        the shell command, axis A
    tool_input.file_path  lib/ktlint_report.py   the edited file, axis C
    stop_hook_active      stop-gate.sh:88        turn-end loop guard, axis B
    cwd, agent_id,        subagent-gate.sh:47-49 subagent boundary, axis D
    agent_type

WHY A MISSING FIELD IS NOT AN EMPTY STRING. The push gate allows when an event
carries no command, because a `Read` event has nothing to gate. If translation
quietly produced an empty command for an event it did not understand, every push
through that harness would be allowed, ungated and silently -- the exact failure
push-gate.sh's own header describes. So this distinguishes three outcomes:

    ok         the event was understood; the canonical document follows
    no-event   understood, and this event has nothing this gate looks at
    unknown    NOT understood -- the caller must deny rather than guess

Only the first two are safe to continue from, and the dispatcher treats
`unknown` on a blocking gate as a denial.

Python 3 standard library only, and no imports from the engine: this runs before
the engine does, in a process the harness started.
