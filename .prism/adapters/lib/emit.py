"""Translate the gate's verdict into the shape this harness reads.

`normalise.py` is the inbound half of the seam; this is the outbound half. The
gates answer in one vocabulary -- an exit status and a reason on stderr -- and
every harness listens in a different one.

WHY THIS IS A SIBLING OF normalise.py RATHER THAN A BRANCH IN prism-hook.
The dispatcher's header argues for one translation table in one testable place.
The inbound half already lives here; the outbound half has strictly MORE
per-harness vocabulary than the inbound half does, and until now it was a single
`if [ "$HARNESS" = "antigravity" ]` at the end of the shell script with four
other harnesses falling past it. Reason text is up to a hundred lines of Gradle
output containing quotes and newlines, so the escaping belongs in json.dumps
rather than in shell quoting.

TWO PROTOCOL FAMILIES.

    exit code   claude-code, codex, copilot -- read the process status and the
                stderr they were handed. Nothing to translate: pass the status
                through VERBATIM, because a gate that died with 127 is not a
                denial and the harness distinguishes them.

    document    cursor, antigravity -- decide from a JSON document on stdout.
                For these an empty stdout is not "allow", it is a FAILED HOOK,
                and Cursor's adapter correctly sets `failClosed: true`, which
                turns a failed hook into a block. That is the whole defect this
                file exists to close: the gates were happy and every command was
                blocked anyway.

WHAT "DENY" MEANS PER EVENT. Two of the four gates cannot block on either
document harness, and the exit status the gate produced does not say so:

    stop        Cursor: `followup_message`, auto-submitted, bounded by
                loop_limit.  Antigravity: `decision: "continue"`, whose `reason`
                is injected as a system message. NEITHER CAN DENY.
    subagent    Cursor: `subagentStop` carries `followup_message`; only
                `subagentStart` can deny, and PRISM does not register it.

So `stop-gate.sh` exiting 2 is a REASON-DELIVERY mechanism, not a verdict: exit
2 is simply the only status that puts a hook's stderr in front of Claude Code.
Returning that 2 to Cursor makes every finding a failed hook on an event that
could not have blocked anyway. Here it becomes a continuation carrying the same
text, which is the `turn_end: "continue"` the manifest has advertised all along
with nothing behind it.

Python 3 standard library only, and no imports from the engine: this runs in a
process the harness started, beside the gate rather than inside it.
